I wanted to create a robust task queuing module that was as flexible as it was useful.  The end goal for this project
is to have a module that can:
* Create task types defined in Javascript through which custom task information can be passed for running.
* Create tasks with custom data and interesting features like parallel execution
* Create Queues to store tasks, run them either in order, in groups, concurrently, or on a schedule. 
* Save tasks and queues to a database letting the user define that functionality for DB flexibility.
* Have output and error reporting that easily mixes with an API of choice.
* Allow users to manipulate and reorder tasks within queues, and between queues.
